## Overview

Comprehensive NDCLab documentation, viewable online at: [https://ndclab.github.io/wiki/](https://ndclab.github.io/wiki/).

Jekyll theme detailed in the original [developer repo](https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs).

## Git Workflow 

#### main branch
The main branch reflects the content of the live site. Commits cannot be made directly to this branch, and all changes must be reviewed (as a pull-request) before merge. 

#### dev branches
New content is added on a development branch. New branches are named to reflect the content being added and the author. For example: `updateREADME-farukh` or `etiquette-jess`. 

Dev branches must be reviewed by a pull-request before being merged into `main`. 

## Navbar Structure

* `_sass/`
    directory that contains [sass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sass_(stylesheet_language)) styling files that control the color-scheme, font, and other NDCLab wiki styles ([light guide to sass](https://sass-lang.com/guide))

* `docs/`
    directory that details the navbar structure; pages and sub-pages (including image content under `_assets`) reside here

* `_config.yml`
    [yaml](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) file that details wiki meta-data (title, theme, logo, etc.) 

* `index.md`
    home-page content:
    ![readme_homepage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NDCLab/wiki/main/docs/_assets/technical/readme_homepage.png)

## Uploading Images

To add an image to any wiki page:
1. Place the image file within the most appropriate subfolder under `docs/_assets/`.
2. Name the image file with an intuitive name. Many existing wiki images are named `[topic]_[detail].png`, such as: `readme_nav-example.png`.
3. Insert the image into your webpage with the appropriate markdown:

```yml
![image-file-name](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NDCLab/wiki/main/image-file-path)
```

For example, the image that appears above (showing the wiki homepage) is called in this markdown file as:

```yml
![readme_homepage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NDCLab/wiki/main/docs/_assets/technical/readme_homepage.png)
```

This method for linking images has two key benefits:
1. The image file is easily accessible within the wiki repo.
2. Given that the `main` branch is the published branch, the image displays correctly upon publication.

However, this method does have one major disadvantage of which users should be aware: the image will **not** render correctly on their working branch until it is merged with `main`. As a result, users are encouraged to double-check all images after the merge with `main` to ensure they are displaying as intended.

## Adding Pages

To add a brand new page on the wiki, copy the `page-template.md` to create a new markdown file inside of the appropriate directory. This markdown file should begin with the following content, which specifies its name and nav order in the wiki structure:

```yml
---
layout: default
title: <title>
parent: <parent-title>
nav_order: <navbar-ordinal-within-this-section>
---

//page content
```

##### Working Example:

The **Community Standards** page is placed in the first navbar position within the **Around the Lab** tab by specifying the following header in the `docs/around-the-lab/community-standards.md` file: 

```yml
---
layout: default
title: Community Standards
parent: Around the Lab
nav_order: 1
---
```

When adding a page, be careful to adjust the `nav_order` for all other pages that reside within that section.

## Adding Sections

To add a brand new section on the wiki (and link it to the left-hand navigation bar), you need to do three things:
1. create a new directory inside of `docs/` named after the new section
2. within this new folder, create the base markdown file that controls the section
3. also within this new folder, create one new markdown page for each content page that will live within this section of the wiki (see [Adding Pages](#adding-pages) section above for details).

The base markdown file (#2 above) specifies the [slug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_URL#Slug) that will be used to access all new pages in the section, as well as its position on the navbar. This markdown file should be named `[slug].md` and should begin with the following content:

```yml
---
layout: default
title: <title>
nav_order: <navbar-ordinal>
has_children: true
permalink: docs/<slug>
---

# <title>
```

When adding a section, be careful to adjust the `nav_order` of any other navbar sections that will be impacted by the addition of a new section. This is accomplished by opening the appropriate markdown file(s) within the associated directory and changing the `nav_order` number in the header(s).

##### Working Example:

The **Around the Lab** tab on the wiki is placed in the fourth position in the navbar by specifying the following header in the `docs/around-the-lab.md` file: 

```yml
---
layout: default
title: Around the Lab
nav_order: 4
has_children: true
permalink: /docs/around-the-lab
---

# Around the Lab
```

## Building Site on Local

To view what the site would look like with the applied formatting and styles as seen on the live site, you can build a local copy by following the steps listed below. 

All commands listed in a quote-block are Terminal commands. 

After completing the listed steps, `bundle exec jekyll serve` is the only command needed to build the local site (unless the gem-files are updated). 

#### Windows/Linux 

1. Navigate to your system's root folder and install Ruby using the [developer documentation](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/).

2. Install bundler and jekyll by running:
    ```
    gem install jekyll bundler
    ```

3. Navigate to the wiki repo and install the newly listed gems using: 
    ```
    cd wiki
    bundle install
    ```

4. Run the following command to build the website on your local machine:
    ```
    bundle exec jekyll serve
    ```

#### MacOS
MacOS comes with a default system installation for Ruby. However, it's advisable to use a separate version of Ruby installed using Homebrew in order to avoid permission errors.

1. Navigate to your system's root folder and install command-line-tools:
    ```
    xcode-select --install
    export SDKROOT=$(xcrun --show-sdk-path)
    ```

2. Install Homebrew by following the instructions on the [Homebrew homepage](https://brew.sh/) to paste a specific command into your Terminal. (This step is unnecessary if you already have Homebrew installed.)

3. Install Ruby using Homebrew commands:
    ```
    brew install ruby
    echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/ruby/bin:/usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/3.0.0/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
    ```

4. Install bundler and jekyll by running:
    ```
    gem install --user-install bundler jekyll
    ```

5. Navigate to the wiki repo and install the listed gems using:
    ```
    cd wiki
    bundle install
    ```

6. Run the following command to build the website on your local machine:
    ```
    bundle exec jekyll serve
    ```
