### Major Goals 

In the more broad sense, this study aims to:

- Understand how individual differences in reading and speech behaviors relate to particular cognitive abilities, personality and social factors. 
- Understand how individual differences in reading and speech behaviors relate to mental health outcomes such as social anxiety. 

More specifically, this study aims to: 

- Determine whether there is an association between social anxiety and speech and reading abilities, as well as specific executive functions (tasks switching, inhibitory control, and working memory).
- Determine whether relations between social anxiety and associations with speech and reading, as well as executive functions more generally, depend on social context or an individual's temperament.
-Explore more how individual differences in speech and reading abilities, other cognitive abilities, personality, or social factors relate to mental health outcomes more generally.
