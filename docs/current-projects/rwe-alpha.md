# real-world-errors-alpha

[insert the main question that the research attempts to answer (one sentence)]

### Background

This study looks at the relationship between certain cognitive abilities, social factors, personality, and mental health outcomes like social anxiety. Prior work suggests that individuals with the temperament type known as “behavioral inhibition” are more likely to develop social anxiety if they also demonstrate particular profiles of cognitive control ability, such as impaired task switching  (White et al., 2011; Buzzell et al., 2020). However, prior assessments of cognitive control are limited in their ecological validity. It is unclear how much these associations depend on the social context in which cognitive control abilities are assessed (i.e. within
social settings as opposed to while alone). Additionally, it remains unclear if these associations depend on the temperament of the individual, personality, social factors, or are present for the majority of individuals with social anxiety. There is some work suggesting that the links between some forms of cognitive control (e.g. error monitoring) and social anxiety are influenced by the social contexts in which cognitive control is evaluated (Buzzell et al., 2017).
