# real-world-errors-alpha

[insert the main question that the research attempts to answer (one sentence)]

### Background


This study looks at the relationship between certain cognitive abilities, social factors, personality, and mental health outcomes like social anxiety. Prior work suggests that individuals with the temperament type known as “behavioral inhibition” are more likely to develop social anxiety if they also demonstrate particular profiles of cognitive control ability, such as impaired task switching  (White et al., 2011; Buzzell et al., 2020). However, prior assessments of cognitive control are limited in their ecological validity. It is unclear how much these associations depend on the social context in which cognitive control abilities are assessed (i.e. within
social settings as opposed to while alone). Additionally, it remains unclear if these associations depend on the temperament of the individual, personality, social factors, or are present for the majority of individuals with social anxiety. There is some work suggesting that the links between some forms of cognitive control (e.g. error monitoring) and social anxiety are influenced by the social contexts in which cognitive control is evaluated (Buzzell et al., 2017).
=======
There is little work investigating the effect of social context on relations between social anxiety and more ecologically valid measures of cognitive control (e.g., cognitive control during speech and reading). Social anxiety is the fear specifically linked to being in a social setting (“Social Anxiety”, n.d.). Previous work as likewise showed a negative correlation between social anxiety and reading comprehension, demonstrating that social anxiety influences performances on tasks dependent on working memory, such as cognitive control tasks (Tysinger et al., 2010). The current study aims to not only close these gaps in the literature, but also provide a broader investigation of how particular cognitive abilities, and personality or social factors, relate to mental health outcomes and real-world scenarios. Towards these ends, participants will perform a reading aloud task (allowing for more ecologically valid cognitive control) twice, once while alone and once while being observed by the experimenter. Additionally, the participants will complete a set of traditional cognitive control tasks (flanker task, dimensional change card sort task, n-back task). Task development was based on the modification of existing paradigms. Participants will also complete a more general battery of questionnaires to assess their thoughts and feelings before and after completing the tasks.
