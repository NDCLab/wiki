# real-world-errors-alpha

[insert the main question that the research attempts to answer (one sentence)]

### Background

There is little work investigating the effect of social context on relations between social anxiety and more ecologically valid measures of cognitive control (e.g., cognitive control during speech and reading). Social anxiety is the fear specifically linked to being in a social setting (“Social Anxiety”, n.d.). Previous work as likewise showed a negative correlation between social anxiety and reading comprehension, demonstrating that social anxiety influences performances on tasks dependent on working memory, such as cognitive control tasks (Tysinger et al., 2010). The current study aims to not only close these gaps in the literature, but also provide a broader investigation of how particular cognitive abilities, and personality or social factors, relate to mental health outcomes and real-world scenarios. Towards these ends, participants will perform a reading aloud task (allowing for more ecologically valid cognitive control) twice, once while alone and once while being observed by the experimenter. Additionally, the participants will complete a set of traditional cognitive control tasks (flanker task, dimensional change card sort task, n-back task). Task development was based on the modification of existing paradigms. Participants will also complete a more general battery of questionnaires to assess their thoughts and feelings before and after completing the tasks.
