## Overview
When we interact with participants, we are representing the lab, CCF, and the university. We want to have a good reputation so participants will want to be a part of our studies. Additionally, consistent professional behavior will help ensure high data quality. Keep in mind the overall lab's [community standards,](https://ndclab.github.io/wiki/docs/around-the-lab/community-standards.html) [roles, and expectations.](https://ndclab.github.io/wiki/docs/around-the-lab/roles-expectations.html)

## Code of Conduct
### High Data Quality
* Maintain a high ethical standard—never fabricate or compromise data.
* Bring up concerns, questions, and potential errors with study lead/PI as soon as possible.
* Keep detailed notes about issues/incidents that may affect the data in the appropriate study tracker.
* Never rename, overwrite, move, or delete files without checking with study lead/PI first.
* Know and understand the protocol: all RAs are responsible for knowing the protocol, regardless of seniority or experimenter role.

### Professionalism
* Always keep language and discussion topics appropriate when working with participants or operating in CCF spaces.
* When interacting with participants and their families, wear clothes that adhere to the [lab's dress code](https://ndclab.github.io/wiki/docs/around-the-lab/roles-expectations.html).
* Participant comfort is paramount: make sure the participant is not experiencing any discomfort and remember that the participant can leave at any time (be careful not to use coercive language to get them to stay).

### General Expectations
* Arrive on time to meetings and participant sessions: arrive 30 minutes before the participant arrives to set up equipment and expect to stay 20-40 minutes after participant to help with cleanup (for synchronous, online sessions via Zoom, log on at least 5 minutes before the scheduled meeting start and stay ~15 minutes after the session ends to organize data).
* Check Slack regularly.
* Treat the equipment with care and respect.
* Communicate openly (and frequently) about your availability and changes to your schedule.
* Let the EEG manager know if there are low EEG supplies (towels, gel, etc.) or if there are issues with the equipment. Let the lab manager know if there are technological issues for synchronous, online sessions via Zoom).
* In addition to logging each participant in the relevant study tracker, log every EEG session or training in the [EEG use log](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LGCHEbIzNx4Aaf4Tcmqo4WBsMIxzlRkiVOQ7i5APAC0/edit?usp=sharing).
