## Introduction
Welcome to the PEPPER-Pipeline project! To get started on collaborating, view the contents below. We welcome contributors from **all** backgrounds! 

The development of the PEPPER-Pipeline is focused on optimizing an automated, flexible, and easy-to-use preprocessing pipeline dedicated to EEG-preprocessing.

Following the optimization of import and preprocessing tools, development will focus on building out a common core of EEG processing tools to handle ERP, time-frequency, and source-based analyses.
