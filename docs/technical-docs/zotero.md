## What is Zotero?

Zotero is a reference manager that allows the lab to have a shared collection of papers and makes it easy for users to add properly formatted in-text citations and bibliographies. 




## Set-Up


#### 1. Create an account

Create an account at [this link.](https://www.zotero.org/user/register) 

#### 2. Get added to the NDC_Lab group library

Send a message to the lab manager with either your Zotero username or the email you used to create an account. They will send you an email invite via Zotero to join the group library.

#### 3. Install the application and Chrome extension

While you wait to be added to the group library, download both the Zotero application and Chrome extension at [at this link.](https://www.zotero.org/download/) 

Once the application is installed, it should automatically install a plugin for Word, at which point you will need to restart Word. If it doesn't auto-install, see [this documentation.](https://www.zotero.org/support/word_processor_plugin_manual_installation)

#### 4. Sync your account

To sync your account to the application, click on Zotero > Preferences > Sync while in the application. Click "Link account" and log in using your Zotero username and password. Zotero should automatically update the group library as others add papers to it. However, Zotero can be manually synced via the circular green arrow at the top right of the application window. 




## Saving Papers


Before you save the pdf via the chrome extension or drag a reference in from another local folder, check the main NDC lab folder to see if it’s already there. 

1.If it doesn't already exist in the group library, save it to your project’s Triage folder with a tag of your project name or acronym. Confirm that Zotero saved a pdf (not a snapshot) and that the metadata (authors' names, title, year published, etc.) that Zotero retrieved is correct.
2. If it does already exist, don’t save it again. Drag it from the main NDC_lab folder to your project folder’s Triage.
    



## Folder Structure


#### NDC_Lab Group Library

The group library can be thought of as a collection of songs and each subcollection/folder within it is a 'playlist' of certain papers. Papers that are removed from subcollections (playlists) are not removed from the group library (all songs) or from other subcollections. 

Note that a collection (my-project-folder) does do not actually "house" its subcollections (Triage, In-Process, Annotated). Every collection and subcollection is an entirely separate folder and the nesting is only visual. As a result, papers and tags found in a subcollection (e.g. Triage) are not searchable from the main collection (my-project-folder), and vice versa.

#### Project folder:

This folder should only contain a [Standalone Note](https://www.zotero.org/support/notes) that lists the conceptual tags that are relevant for that project. No papers are saved in this folder. 

#### Triage: 

This folder is a staging area for papers. A lab member confident in paper triage will determine if the paper is relevant to the project and worth annotating. If it passes, it gets added to the In-Process folder and removed from Triage. If it fails, it gets removed from collection (NOT trashed from library as a whole), and project tag is removed.

#### In-Process:

This folder is for papers that need to be annotated or are actively in the process of being annotated. Once they have been annotated, they are removed from the In-Process folder and added to the Annotated folder.

#### Annotated: 

This folder is for papers that have been fully read and annotated for a literature review. Papers in this folder should also have the relevant conceptual tags for the project. 




## Creating and Navigating Tags


Papers can be assigned tags that sort papers by topic. A project might have tags that refer to theories, concepts, or methods. The tags should be developed by members of the project and listed in a Standalone Note to ensure that all project members are using the same tags. A project's Standalone Note lives in the main project folder.

Certain tags might be utilized for multiple projects. In order to make sure tags stay standardized across the lab, there's a Standalone Note in the main NDC_Lab folder that contains the tags from all of the lab's projects called "NDCLab Conceptual Tags". Refer to this Note before adding new tags to your project.

Papers in a subcollection or in the main NDC_Lab group library can be filtered by clicking tags on and off in the lower left-hand corner of the Zotero app. Clicking multiple tags will narrow your search further. Clicking on an already selected tag will remove it as a search parameter. 




## Quick Tips


1. This website has an overview of all of Zotero’s features: https://www.zotero.org/support/quick_start_guide 
2. The Zotero app must be open and running on your computer for the Chrome extension to work.
3. Once you save a pdf to a folder, it should automatically retrieve the metadata from the pdf so it's accessible for citation purposes and so it can be sorted by the author, date published, title, abstract, etc in the Zotero app. If it doesn't load it automatically, right click on a pdf in the app and click Retrieve Metadata. You may have to manually type in the info or correct the info it generates. 
4. Triage should have the project name on it so when using the Chrome extension, lab members can be sure they're saving to the correct folder. Project names are not added to the In Process and Annotated folders to reduce visual noise.
