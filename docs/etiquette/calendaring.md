## Overview
This page provides information about acessing and modifiying the various Google Calendars managed by the NDC Lab. If you have any questions about the information on this page, please contact the Lab Manager.


## Junior RA Calendars
All grant-affiliated junior RA activities are managed on the Grant-Affiliated Junior RA calendar. Non-grant-affiliated junior RA activities are managed on separate calendars that are owned and maintained by the study lead coordinating the project to which those non-grant-affiliated junior RAs are assigned.

#### Grant-Affiliated Junior RA Calendar
The Lab Manager is responsible for creating a schedule for grant-affiliated junior RAs at the start of each semester. This schedule will consist of two 4-hour shifts for each junior RA, during which time that junior RA must be available every week. The standard shift times are as follows:

* Weekday mornings (M-F) from 9am-1:30pm EST
* Weekday evenings (M-F) from 4:30-9pm EST
* Weekend mornings (Sat-Sun) from 9am-1:30pm EST
* Weekend evenings (Sat-Sun from 1:30-6pm EST

These standard shift times can be adjusted at the start of the semester as needed. However, the shifts listed above were selected given that they provide coverage for the times that grant-funded study visits are most likely to be scheduled.

Grant-affiliated junior RAs shifts will be added to the Grant-Affiliated Junior RA calendar at the beginning of each semester and will be colored gray, to distinguish them from events during which the junior RA is scheduled to assist with labwork. Each shift will indicate the junior RA assigned at that time, as well as the languages they speak, and the IRB protocols on which they are approved.

**Note that no RA can be scheduled to assist with a given project before they are approved on that project's IRB protocol. To ensure an RA is approved on the relevant IRB protocol before scheduling them, you must check the IRB status listed on their shift on the calendar as well as [this IRB-approved-personnel spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TQ6WtZbbm9vlFobMq_Nu88UXGpo-a3DvXzzELrG4Ir8/edit?usp=sharing).**

The Grant-Affiliated Junior RA calendar must be updated every time a grant-affiliated junior RA is scheduled to help with labwork (e.g., for a study visit, training, meeting, task, etc.). To do so, the person scheduling the RA should add an event to the calendar that is colored red and indicates the RA's name and what they are scheduled for in the following format: "`Name` \| `Task`". These events are added to the calendar in addition to, not in place of, the RA's regular weekly shift events.

The calendar is also updated any time an RA notifies the Lab Manager that they will be unavailable for a given period of time (due to sickness, traveling, etc.). If possible, make up shifts will be assigned for anyone who is unavailable for their regular shift in order to maintain full shift coverage every week.

## Room Calendars
The NDC Lab maintains various room calendars to organize room bookings amongst lab members. Any time one of these rooms needs to be booked for a given activity, an event must be added to the calendar. These rooms cannot be double booked; therefore, if a room is needed at a time during which it is already booked, a different room will have to be used. Contact the Lab Manager with any questions.

#### DM 200C (Small Room)
This calendar exists to enable booking of the small room in our lab's DM space, DM 200C. This room is often used by study leads to conduct behavioral study visits.

If adding an event to this calendar to book the room, you must include the following details: your name, the name of the event, and an indication of the noise level that must be maintained in room DM 200A during the event. The possible noise levels are: no talking in DM 200A, quiet talking in DM 200A, or no noise restrictions for DM 200A. The event details should be added in the following format: "`Name` \| `Event` `(Noise level)`".

Anyone planning to use DM 200A must check the calendar for DM 200C before entering DM 200A to ensure they adhere to the noise level required at that time, if applicable.

#### AHC5 123 (BV EEG)
This calendar exists to enable booking of room 123 in AHC-5, which houses the Brain Vision EEG system. This room is primarily booked for grant-funded study visits, and sometimes for EEG training sessions. Contact the Lab Manager if you need access to this calendar.
