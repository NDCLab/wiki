## Overview
In order to ensure junior RA scheduling is handled in a organized and efficient manner, all lab members who are in the position of scheduling junior RAs for tasks, trainings, study visits, etc. must follow the rules laid out in this section. For more information on accessing the Grant-Affiliated Junior RA calendar, visit the Calendaring page in this section of the wiki.

Note that in the event that an exeption to any of the rules on this page needs to be requested, **the request should be sent to both the Schedule Coordinator and Lab Manager**, who will decide whether the exeption can be made.


## Scheduling Rules
1. Any junior RA who is trained as a primary RA for a grant-funded study should not be scheduled as an RA for any other studies. If a primary RA is not scheduled to run a study visit during their regular weekly shift, they will use that time to do recruitment calling to recruit and schedule participants for the grant-funded study (or studies) that they assit with.
2. Junior RAs who are not trained as primary RAs for grant-funded studies are divided into two groups: grant-affiliated and non-grant-affilitated.
    * Grant-affiliated RAs may be scheduled to help with non-grant-funded studies as needed, but they can always be bumped if they become needed to help with a grant-funded study at the time they were scheduled for a non-grant-funded study.
    * Grant-affiliated RAs may not be scheduled to help with non-grant-funded studies on retainer. Grant-affiliated RAs can only be scheduled to help with a non-grant-funded study visit once there are participants confirmed for that time slot.
    * Non-grant-affiliated RAs will not be scheduled to help with grant-funded studies. Their scheduling will be managed exclusively by the study lead with whom they are working.
4. Full coverage for grant-funded studies is attained when there are two grant-affiliated RAs assigned to every weekday evening shift and every weekend morning and evening shift.
    * Once the lab has attained full coverage for grant-funded studies, incoming RAs may be assigned as non-grant-affiliated as needed.
5. Grant-affiliated RAs can't be scheduled outside of their two assigned shifts each week, and therefore should only complete labwork for a maximum of 9 hours a week. The week starts on Sunday.
6. All tasks that are assigned to grant-affiliated RAs must be added to the Grant-Affiliated Junior RA calendar, including study visits, trainings, and any other tasks they are assigned to help with during their weekly shifts.
