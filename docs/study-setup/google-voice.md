## Overview
It is required that all study leads have a personal Google Voice account that they are able to use to contact study participants regarding data collection visits. If a study protocol ever instructs you to use Google Voice, this is a reference to your personal Google Voice account, not a shared lab account.

## Setup
When setting up your personal Google Voice account, you should choose a number with either a (305) or (786) area code. If you run into issues when creating your Google Voice account, contact the lab manager.

## Logging In
You can log in to Google Voice by visiting [www.voice.google.com](https://voice.google.com), or you can access the Google Voice app on your phone. Be sure that you are logged into your personal account, not a shared lab account.
