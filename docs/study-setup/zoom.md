## Overview
The lab has six study-specific Zoom/Outlook accounts that can be used for data collection purposes. If your study will involve Zoom, reach out to the lab manager to be assigned a shared lab account.


## Logging In
You can log in to the Zoom app with either your personal FIU AD credentials or the credentials of a shared lab account. (While it is also possible to use an FIU student account, this is not recommended as there are some restrictions on student accounts that are not mirrored in AD accounts.) Be aware that you will need to input your PID to initiate two-factor authentication.


## Participant Sessions
Without exception, all participant sessions scheduled on Zoom must have a password and must have the waiting room enabled. These are security precautions that are written into all lab IRB protocols. If you are unsure how to set either of these up, reach out to the lab manager for assistance.


## RA Scheduling Privileges
For studies that take place over Zoom, it can be helpful for RAs to be able to schedule and log on to meetings with their personal AD account, as opposed to the shared study account. To set such privileges:

1. Check with the RA to ensure they have previously logged into Zoom with their AD account (not student).
2. Log in to [fiu.zoom.us](https://fiu.zoom.us) with the shared account credentials.
3. Click "Settings" on the lefthand sidebar.
4. Scroll down to "Schedule Privilege."
5. Click the "+" next to "Assign scheduling privilege to" and type in the AD account of the RA. Click "Assign."

The most common issue that prevents assignment is when the individual has never actually logged in to Zoom with their AD account. If you hit an error, simply ask the RA to log in again with their AD account, then try once more.
