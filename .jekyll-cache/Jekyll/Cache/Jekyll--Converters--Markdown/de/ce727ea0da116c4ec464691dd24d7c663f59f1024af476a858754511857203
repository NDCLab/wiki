<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Zotero is a reference manager that allows the lab to have a shared collection of papers and makes it easy for users to add properly formatted in-text citations and bibliographies.</p>

<h2 id="set-up">Set-Up</h2>

<h3 id="1-create-an-account">1. Create an account</h3>

<p>Create an account at <a href="https://www.zotero.org/user/register">this link.</a></p>

<h3 id="2-get-added-to-the-ndc_lab-group-library">2. Get added to the NDC_Lab group library</h3>

<p>Send a message to the lab manager with either your Zotero username or the email you used to create an account. They will send you an email invite to join the group library.</p>

<h3 id="3-install-the-application-and-chrome-extension">3. Install the application and Chrome extension</h3>

<p>While you wait to be added to the group library, download both the Zotero application and Chrome extension at <a href="https://www.zotero.org/download/">at this link.</a></p>

<p>Once the application is installed, it should automatically install a plugin for Word, at which point you will need to restart Word. If it doesn‚Äôt auto-install, see <a href="https://www.zotero.org/support/word_processor_plugin_manual_installation">this documentation.</a></p>

<h3 id="4-sync-your-account">4. Sync your account</h3>

<p>To sync your online account with your local copy of the application, open the local application and navigate to: Zotero &gt; Preferences &gt; Sync. Click ‚ÄúLink account‚Äù and log in using your Zotero username and password. Zotero should now automatically update the group library as others add papers to it. However, Zotero can be manually synced via the circular green arrow at the top right of the application window.</p>

<h2 id="saving-papers">Saving Papers</h2>

<p>Before you save a pdf to Zotero, either via the Chrome extension or by dragging a pdf in from another local folder, check the main NDC_Lab folder to see if the paper already exists in the lab‚Äôs library.</p>

<ol>
  <li>If the paper <strong>does not</strong> exist in the group library, save it to your project‚Äôs Triage folder; immediately add your project tag (e.g. ‚Äòrwe‚Äô). Confirm that Zotero saved a pdf (not a snapshot) and that the metadata (authors‚Äô names, title, year published, etc.) is correct. If necessary, manually correct the metadata.</li>
  <li>If the paper <strong>does</strong> already exist in the group library, <strong>do not</strong> save it again. Instead, drag it from the main NDC_Lab folder to your project folder‚Äôs Triage subfolder to ‚Äúadd‚Äù it to your collection of papers for triage.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="folder-structure">Folder Structure</h2>

<h3 id="ndc_lab-group-library">NDC_Lab Group Library</h3>

<p>The group library can be thought of as a collection of songs. Each subcollection (folder) within it acts like a ‚Äòplaylist‚Äô of certain papers. Papers that are removed from subcollections (playlists) are not removed from the group library (all songs) or from other subcollections.</p>

<p>Note that a given collection (for example, ‚Äúmy-project-folder‚Äù) does do not actually ‚Äúhouse‚Äù its subcollections (Triage, In-Process, Annotated). Every collection and subcollection is an entirely separate folder and the nesting is only visual. As a result, papers and tags found in a subcollection (e.g. Triage) are not searchable from the main collection (my-project-folder), and vice versa.</p>

<h3 id="main-project-folder">Main project folder</h3>

<p>No papers are saved in this folder. It only contains a <a href="https://www.zotero.org/support/notes">Standalone Note</a> that lists the conceptual tags that are relevant for the project.</p>

<h4 id="triage">Triage</h4>

<p>This folder is a staging area for papers that may be relevant for the literature review. A lab member confident in paper triage will determine if the paper is relevant to the project and worth annotating.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If a paper passes triage, it gets added to the In-Process folder and removed from Triage.</li>
  <li>If a paper fails triage, it gets removed from collection (NOT trashed from library as a whole), and the project tag is removed.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="in-process">In-Process</h4>

<p>This folder is for papers that have been confirmed as relevant for the literature review and now need to be annotated (or are actively in the process of being annotated). Once they have been annotated, they are removed from the In-Process folder and added to the Annotated folder.</p>

<h4 id="annotated">Annotated</h4>

<p>This folder is for papers that have been read and annotated for a literature review. Relevant conceptual tags are added to the paper when it is added to the Annotated folder.</p>

<h2 id="creating-and-navigating-tags">Creating and Navigating Tags</h2>

<p>Papers can be assigned tags and these tags can then be used to filter the library by topic. A project might have tags that refer to theories, concepts, or methods. The tags should be developed by members of the project and listed in a Standalone Note to ensure that all project members are using the same tags. A project‚Äôs Standalone Note lives in the main project folder.</p>

<p>Certain tags might be utilized for multiple projects. In order to make sure tags stay standardized across the lab, there‚Äôs a Standalone Note in the main NDC_Lab folder; this note contains labwide tags and is called ‚ÄúNDCLab Conceptual Tags‚Äù. Refer to this Note before adding new tags to your project.</p>

<p>Papers in a subcollection or in the main NDC_Lab group library can be filtered by clicking tags on and off in the lower left-hand corner of the Zotero app. Clicking multiple tags will narrow your search further. Clicking on an already selected tag will remove it as a search parameter.</p>

<h2 id="quick-tips">Quick Tips</h2>

<ol>
  <li>For an overview of all of Zotero‚Äôs features, click <a href="https://www.zotero.org/support/quick_start_guide">here</a>.</li>
  <li>The Zotero app must be open and running on your computer for the Chrome extension to work.</li>
  <li>Once you save a pdf to a folder, it should automatically retrieve the metadata from the pdf so it‚Äôs accessible for citation purposes and so it can be sorted by the author, date published, title, abstract, etc in the Zotero app. If it doesn‚Äôt load it automatically, right click on a pdf in the app and click Retrieve Metadata. You may have to manually type in the info or correct the info it generates.</li>
  <li>Triage folders should include the project name in the folder name. When using the Chrome extension, this makes it easy for lab members to be sure they are saving a paper to the correct folder. Project names are not added to the In-Process and Annotated folders to reduce visual noise within the library.</li>
  <li>After selecting a paper within the app, you can highlight all collections that contain this paper by holding down the ‚ÄúOption‚Äù key on Mac OS X, the ‚ÄúControl‚Äù key on Windows, or the ‚ÄúAlt‚Äù key on Linux.‚Äù</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="caveats">Caveats</h2>

<p>Avoid creating any modifications‚Äîlike notes or highlights‚Äîto an article or journal under the Group Library entitled NDC_Lab folder on Zotero. Any modifications should be done so only after one has created an individual copy of the paper so that the changes aren‚Äôt reflected onto the lab‚Äôs archives.</p>

<p>To make an individual copy of a paper refer to the following steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Locate the file for the article of interest under ‚ÄúNDC_Lab.‚Äù</li>
  <li>Drag the original file of the article onto ‚ÄúMy Library.‚Äù</li>
  <li>Apply any modifications to the the article under this new file in ‚ÄúMy Library.‚Äù (Tip for Mac users: Before adding notes or highlights to your own copy using Preview, go to File&gt;Export as PDF, then swap out the Zotero file in ‚ÄúMy Library‚Äù for this new export. This helps ensure stability in the modifications, which otherwise have a tendency to randomly disappear!)</li>
